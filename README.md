# Forest_Conservation_Robot
A forest conservation robotics is a new challenging field. To co-operate with forest. Forest conservation robots is Â Automatic Four-Wheel Drive (A4WD) robot. Robot having conservation functionality Reforestation, Controlled burn. Implementing forest Conservation, robot having functionalities like plant seedling to reforest land, count trees during tree measuring efforts, help prevent and suppress forest fire with forest intelligence system. Robot is Autonomously travel In forest through the given specified path and motion feedback sensors. with the help of the fire detection sensor robot detect fire and operator see on live video stream and take action
