# Forest_Conservation_Robot
 
A forest conservation robotics is a new challenging field To co-operate with forest.
Implementing forest Conservation, robot having functionalities like plant seedling to reforest land, count trees during tree measuring efforts, help prevent and suppress forest fire with forest intelligence system.
Robot is Autonomously travel In forest through the given specified path and motion feedback sensors. With the help of the fire detection sensor robot detect fire and operator see on live video stream and take action
As shown in below block diagram, the complete system can be divided into main four functional units such as Controlling UI with IOT, Robot motion, Controlling burn and Reforest.
The control unit(MCU) includes a Wi-Fi for IOT. IOT is used to give input parameters to MCU to operate Robot. The input parameters are Direction, speed, digging, seeding, water. The MCU plays vital role in the proposed system. The MCU is programmed to control all sensors and relays which operate DC motors, servo motor through servo driver.
Robot motion involves motors, shaft, wheels, motor driver, Inertial measurement unit, Ultrasonic sensor, Servo motor, Servo driver.
The controlling burn involves fire detection sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor, and also accuracy of the robot having addition feature live camera stream.
The Reforest is semi-autonomous process which involves relay, digging, seeding, water for seed.
