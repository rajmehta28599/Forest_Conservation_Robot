Download the Arduino Software (IDE) (for arduino nano)
	link:  https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
	1.Get the latest version from the download page. You can choose between the Installer (.exe) and the Zip packages. We suggest you use the first one that installs directly everything you need to use the Arduino Software (IDE), including the drivers. With the Zip package you need to install the drivers manually. The Zip file is also useful if you want to create a portable installation.
	2.When the download finishes, proceed with the installation and please allow the driver installation process when you get a warning from the operating system.
	3.Choose the components to install
	4.Choose the installation directory (we suggest to keep the default one)
	The process will extract and install all the required files to execute properly the Arduino Software (IDE)



Installing Nano on Debian/Ubuntu (for raspberry pi)
	To install Nano text editor on Debian or Ubuntu machines, execute the following command:

		" $ sudo apt-get install nano"
	Wait for the installation process to finish.

	The sudo part is meant for running this command as a root user. This means you may be prompted to enter a password in case you are currently not logged in as a root user.

		"$yum install nano"
	That is it for the installation. As soon as the setup ends, you can use it immediately!
